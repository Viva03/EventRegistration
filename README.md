# 🎉 Event Registration Web App

This is a fully functional web application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC** (without Entity Framework) and **SQL Server**, designed to manage event registrations. The frontend uses HTML, CSS (dark theme), and JavaScript, while the backend uses ADO.NET for database operations.
